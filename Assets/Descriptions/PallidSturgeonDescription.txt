Pallid sturgeon, “Scaphirhynchus albus”
  
Physical Description: With a dinosaur-like appearance, these fish can weigh around 80 pounds and grow up to six feet long. They have a long flat head and hard, bony plates (called scutes) instead of scales. Because they do not have teeth, their mouth acts as a vacuum that sucks up prey.
  
Ecological Function: Endangered species, migratory fish. They eat aquatic insects and other fish. Keeps these smaller species of fish and insects in check, while cleaning the habitat around them.
  
Can live to be about 80 years old, and migrate up to 100 miles to reproduce. Females spawn every two years, while males spawn almost every year. 
  
Commonly found in large, deep turbid river channels, usually in strong current over firm sand or gravel
