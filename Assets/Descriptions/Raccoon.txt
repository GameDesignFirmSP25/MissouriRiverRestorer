Raccoon, "Procyon lotor"
  
Physical description: A medium sized furry mammal with a white face that has a black ‘mask’ pattern around the eyes. The rest of the fur tends to be mostly light grey with hints of black, with the tail having black rings. Has a pointed muzzle and short ears, with long and slender feet that are good at grasping.
  
Ecological Function: Is able to be hunted at times due to them often interfering with people and invading their homes. Eats a wide variety of plants and animals, from grasses and nuts to fish, insects, rodents, and snakes. They do help spread seeds from fruits they eat.
  
Mating tends to occur in February, with young being born in April-May. Raccoons live with their mothers until the next spring.
  
Lives throughout all of Missouri, primarily in forests near the water, near caves, or in urban and suburban settlements.
