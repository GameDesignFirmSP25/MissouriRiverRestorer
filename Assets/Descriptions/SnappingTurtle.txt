Snapping turtle, "Chelydra serpentina serpentina"
  
Physical description: A large aquatic turtle with a large pointed head, a long and thick tail, and a small lower shell. Upper shell is tan or brown, but usually covered with algae and mud and somewhat smooth looking. Not to be confused with the alligator snapping turtle, which is larger with a spiky shell and a more pronounced hook mouth, and which is declining in population and a protected species.
  
Ecological Function: Deemed a nuisance due to attacking ducklings and goslings, allowed to be hunted with certain restrictions but is overall positive. About 33% of its diet is aquatic plants, also eats birds, small mammals, fish, crayfish, and insects.
  
Egg laying occurs in May-June, with a lifespan of 40 years.
  
Lives anywhere where thereâ€™s permanent water, preferably with mud at the bottom. Lives statewide.
