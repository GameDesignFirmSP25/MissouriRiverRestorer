Physical description: A white flower with yellow notes near the middle and a yellow center, theyâ€™re held above the water on stems with circular, blue-ish leaves. Seeds are acorn-like in pits.
  
Ecological Function: The roots, shoots, and unripe seeds are edible for humans. The seeds are eaten by waterfowl and the plant as a whole acts as shelter for ducks and fish. Can act as a nuisance if introduced to fishing areas due to how fast it spreads.
  
Regularly makes seeds but primarily spreads via the underwater roots.
  
Lives scattered statewide on top of still waters with muddy bottoms.
