Yellow Coneflower, “Echinacea paradoxa”
  
Physical Description: Can grow up to three feet tall, and bloom a beautiful bright yellow in the summer. This is the only species in the genus that grows this yellow color instead of the typical purple. The petals are long and drooping, with very large, coppery-brown to chocolate-brown central cones.
  
Ecological Function: Food for adult butterflies and goldfinches (goldfinches visit in winter to eat the dead flower’s seeds).
  
Blooms in summer (June-August), but dead flower stems will remain erect well into the winter.
  
Commonly found in glades and prairies in the Ozark regions of Missouri.
