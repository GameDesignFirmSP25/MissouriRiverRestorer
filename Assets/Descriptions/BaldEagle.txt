Physical Description: Large, powerful birds with a signature white head and white tail. They also have bright yellow bills and yellow legs.

Ecological Function: Formerly endangered species, their main source of food is fish. However, they also hunt waterfowl, shorebirds, waterbirds, turtles, rabbits, snakes, and other small animals. They are also known to scavenge on dead fish and animals. Regulates the populations of smaller fish and animals, while also clearing away dead fauna.
  
Can live up to 30 years in the wild, and are capable of breeding at 4 or 5 years (some dense populations may not breed until much older).
  
Commonly found nesting near rivers, lakes, and marshes. They require a good food base, perching areas, and nesting sites.
