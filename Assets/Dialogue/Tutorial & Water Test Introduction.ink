<color=\#7F00FF>Dr. Waterson</color>: “Ah-ha! There you are!”

Player: Dr. Waterson! It’s nice to finally meet you.”

<color=\#7F00FF>Dr. Waterson</color>: "Likewise, ohohoho!"
<color=\#7F00FF>Dr. Waterson</color>: “But as much as I would love to chat, we’ve got business to attend to!" 
<color=\#7F00FF>Dr. Waterson</color>: "Let's cut to the chase.”

Player: “Of course. What needs to be done?”

<color=\#7F00FF>Dr. Waterson</color>: “Unfortunately, the river here has deteriorated and the native wildlife have all moved onto greener pastures.”
<color=\#7F00FF>Dr. Waterson</color>: “Or perhaps ‘bluer streams’ would be more appropriate. Ohohoho!”
<color=\#7F00FF>Dr. Waterson</color>: “All joking aside, the state of things here has started to affect the rest of the local environment.”

<color=\#7F00FF>Dr. Waterson</color>: “Hence why I want you to restore this riverbank to pristine condition!”
<color=\#7F00FF>Dr. Waterson</color>: “Head over to the water testing area, and I’ll instruct you further!”
