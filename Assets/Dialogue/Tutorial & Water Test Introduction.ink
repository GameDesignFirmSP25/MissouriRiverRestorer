Dr. Waterson: “Ah-ha! Over here!”

Student: “Dr. Waterson! It’s nice to finally meet you.”

Dr. Waterson: "Likewise, ohohoho!"
Dr. Waterson: “But as much as I would love to chat, we’ve got business to attend to!" 
Dr. Waterson: "Let's cut to the chase.”

Student: “Of course. What needs to be done?”

Dr. Waterson: “Take a look at the riverbank, won’t you?”

Student: “The riverbank?”
Student: “What for?”

Dr. Waterson: “Well, it’s in complete disarray. A sorry sight, isn’t it?”

Student: “Oh yeah, it’s awful… those dead plants–and where did all the animals go?”

Dr. Waterson: “The ecosystem of the river has deteriorated and they’ve moved onto greener pastures.”
Dr. Waterson: “Or perhaps ‘bluer streams’ would be more appropriate. Ohohoho!”
Dr. Waterson: “All joking aside, the state of things here has started to affect the rest of the local environment.”

Dr. Waterson: “Hence why I want you to restore this riverbank to pristine condition!”

Student: “Wait, just me?!”
Student: “Are you sure you don’t want someone more experienced?”

Dr. Waterson: “Nonsense, I have full faith in you!”
Dr. Waterson: “Besides, I won’t be leaving you in the lurch. I’ll show you the ropes for everything you’ll need to do before returning to my own site.”


Student: “But the water is such a gross brown...”

Dr. Waterson: “Indeed. Yet, looks can only tell us so much.”

Student: “What do you mean?”

Dr. Waterson: “Well, for all we know, the water could just look brown from kicked up sediments.”
Dr. Waterson: “To be sure, we need to test the water quality of the river.”
Dr. Waterson: “Here. Take these test tubes. I’ll run you through the process.”
Dr. Waterson: “Head over to the water testing area, and I’ll instruct you further!”
