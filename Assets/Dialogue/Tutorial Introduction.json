You’ve certainly come into your own from that timid student way back when. Ohohoho!”","\n","^Player: “I still can’t believe I’m out here with you, Professor.”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “Now, now! No more of that ‘Professor’ jargon.”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “We’re colleagues now. ‘William’ is just fine by me.”","\n","^Player: “Oh! I dunno if I can do that just yet. I think I’ll just start with ‘Doctor’ and work from there.”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “Ohohoho, fair enough! But that’s enough chewing the fat. We’ve got business to attend to.”","\n","^Player: “Of course. What needs to be done?”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “Take a look at the riverbank, won’t you?”","\n","^Player: “The riverbank?”","\n","^Player: “What for?”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “Well, it’s in complete disarray. A sorry sight, isn’t it?”","\n","^Player: “Oh yeah, it’s awful… those dead plants–and where did all the animals go?”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “The ecosystem of the river has deteriorated and they’ve moved onto greener pastures.”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “Or perhaps ‘bluer streams’ would be more appropriate. Ohohoho!”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “All joking aside, the state of things here has started to affect the rest of the local environment.”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “Hence why I want you to restore this riverbank to pristine condition!”","\n","^Player: “Wait, just me?!”","\n","^Player: “Are you sure you don’t want someone more experienced?”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “Nonsense, I have full faith in you!”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “Besides, I won’t be leaving you in the lurch. I’ll show you the ropes for everything you’ll need to do before returning to my own site.”","\n","^Player: “But the water is such a gross brown.”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “Indeed. Yet, looks can only tell us so much.”","\n","^Player: “What do you mean?”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “Well, for all we know, the water could just look brown from kicked up sediments.”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “To be sure, we need to test the water quality of the river.”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “Here. Take these test tubes. I’ll run you through the process.”","\n","^Dr. Waterson: “Head over to the water testing area, and I’ll instruct you further!”","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
