Student: “Here are the samples!”

Dr. Waterson: “Great work! Unfortunately, it seems like the water quality here is very poor.”
Dr. Waterson: “Did you notice all that garbage floating by?”

Student: “Yeah, it was awful…”

Dr. Waterson: “I would say our next course of action is addressing all of that litter.”
Dr. Waterson: “I know that all these dead plants are an eyesore too, but we’ll deal with them later.”

Student: “What? Why?”
Student: “Wouldn’t it be easier to replace them with some native plantlife and draw some of the animals back?”

Dr. Waterson: “I understand why you think that. Thus, let me pose a question.”
Dr. Waterson: “Suppose we do as you say; native flora are planted and fauna return.”
Dr. Waterson: “But what happens when the polluted water soaks into the ground where the plants get their nutrients?”

Student: “I guess it wouldn’t be great for them…”

Dr. Waterson: “We can’t do things by half here, my friend.”

Student: “Of course, that makes sense.”

Dr. Waterson: “So, first, we need to remove the pollutants outside the river.”
Dr. Waterson: “I noticed an area that was particularly polluted. Head over there, and I’ll let you know what to do next!”
