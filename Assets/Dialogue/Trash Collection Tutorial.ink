Player: “All this trash… The smell is horrendous.”
William: “This area has become a common dumping ground for anything anyone doesn’t want.”
William: “Luckily, the city has cracked down on issuing fines for this sort of thing and it’s dropped dramatically.”

Player: “Doesn’t remove what’s already here, though.”
William: “That’s where you come in, ohohoho!”
Player: “I was afraid you’d say that.”
William: “None of that now! Getting our hands dirty is in the job description!”
William: “Just walk around and pick up all the trash you see.”
